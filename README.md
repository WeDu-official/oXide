update log after the 1.0 update:


-THE new W1.0(WeDu software base environment):


this update is very, very important for YOU
as a user because if we wanted to make any of our
under-support software into app version they would be huge
like the simple Xcceleratext program would be at least 350 or 400 mb
like it's just a text editor so if we made more software at future
without the new environment the sizes would be so unnecessarily large
and pain to download,store and mange.

so instead of all of that we made that the base environment of all apps
(which is nearly the same with little differences but because of each app got its
own environment that made them so large) turned into a one main environment
that all apps depend on that would make our programs much smaller for example:

**the previous version(1.7A1) of XVX Browser was 950 MB**

**but the new W1.0 version of XVX Browser is only 230 MB !!**


**The first release Features are**
